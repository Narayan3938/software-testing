> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
     The webapp was well-structured and easy to navigate. The login functionality worked as expected, and the error messages were clear and helpful. I was able to complete all of the test cases successfully.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
    I used a combination of manual and automated testing techniques. I manually tested the login functionality, and I used Selenium to automate the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of issues. I documented my test cases in a spreadsheet and used version control to track changes.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     

Yes, I would recommend using a tool like Zephyr or Jira to manage test cases. These tools provide a more centralized and organized way to store and track test cases.
## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
I used Visual Studio Code to edit my test files. I am familiar with Atom and Sublime Text as well, but I prefer Visual Studio Code for its features and integration with Git

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-Yes, I did encounter some trouble. I was initially having trouble getting Selenium to interact with the webapp. I was able to resolve the issue by updating the Selenium WebDriver executable.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
 
Yes, I have used Github before. I initially had some trouble getting used to the interface, but I was able to figure it out after a few hours of practice.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use Selenium to automate these test cases. Selenium is a popular open-source framework that is widely used for automating web applications. It is mature, well-supported, and has a large community of users.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 

According to a recent survey by Indeed, the top skills and competencies in software testing are:
Experience with Selenium, Cypress, or other web automation frameworks
Experience with Agile methodologies
Strong understanding of software testing principles and practices
Excellent communication and collaboration skills
Ability to learn new technologies quickly

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
I would need to develop the following technical and soft skills:

Experience with additional automation frameworks, such as Appium and Puppeteer
Experience with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines
Experience with cloud-based testing platforms
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
Ability to work independently and as part of a team
Excellent written and verbal communication skills



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-

The project helped me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice in a real-world setting. I was able to apply the concepts of software testing that I had learned in class to a specific application. I also gained experience with a variety of testing tools and techniques. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project, and I believe that it has helped me to become a more well-rounded software tester.
